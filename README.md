# IDWatch
A passive wearable device with 125 kHz RFID and 13.56 MHz NFC capabilities, programmable via any NFC or RFID writer. Made for Hack Club's Alleyway program.

In the shape of a standard watch, IDWatch is a device wearable on your wrist that will let you impress the non-techies in your life. Simply tap the face of your watch to their phone, the metro gates, the dining hall meal swipe reader, your building door, etc... and watch them be amazed. No longer will you require an ID card to do things that previously required specialized NFC and RFID readers... because now you have one on your wrist.

Functionally, it's very simple -- it's a well-designed small 3D printed labeled chip with two prefabricated integrated circuits, one for each frequency used: 13.56 MHz (NFC) and 125 kHz (RFID). These are programmable with various writers (NFC Tools app on your phone works for NFC, and you'll need a more heavy-duty thing like a Proxmark3 for the RFID one). 

While it's simple, I feel that this project requires more work in software and programming it to work than it is to assemble, and overall a similar amount of work as a simple electronics project. I think it's a good start as I try to make more complicated wearable devices (such as a location-tracking device and smart glasses) in the coming days and weeks for Alleyway!
